Problem 6: Data Hazard with Forwarding and Stalling

Consider a 5-stage pipeline (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB). The following instructions execute:

I1: LW R1, 0(R2)  
I2: ADD R3, R1, R4  
I3: SUB R5, R3, R6

Assume EX-to-EX forwarding is available, but load-use hazard still causes one stall cycle.

(a) How many stall cycles are required?

(b) If forwarding is disabled, how many extra stalls are needed?

Solution

(a) With Forwarding

I1 (LW) loads R1, but I2 (ADD) needs R1 in EX.

Since load-use hazards cannot be avoided by forwarding, I2 stalls for 1 cycle.

I3 (SUB) needs R3, but EX-to-EX forwarding provides the value immediately.


\text{Total stalls} = 1

(b) Without Forwarding

I2 stalls 1 cycle because of load-use hazard.

I3 (SUB) also stalls 1 cycle to get R3 from I2's WB stage.


\text{Total stalls} = 2
