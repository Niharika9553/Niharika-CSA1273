Problem 3: Data Hazard - Forwarding vs. Stalling

Consider a 5-stage pipeline (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB). The following instruction sequence is executed:

I1: ADD R1, R2, R3  
I2: SUB R4, R1, R5  
I3: AND R6, R4, R7

Assume no forwarding is available. How many stalls are needed? What if forwarding is enabled?

Solution

Without Forwarding

I1 (ADD) writes R1 in WB (cycle 5).

I2 (SUB) reads R1 in ID (cycle 2), but the correct value is not available until cycle 5.

This requires 3 stall cycles between I1 and I2.

Similarly, I3 (AND) depends on R4 from I2, adding 3 more stalls.


Pipeline Diagram (Without Forwarding & With Stalls)

Total stalls = 3 (for I2) + 3 (for I3) = 6 cycles

With Forwarding

With EX-to-EX forwarding, I2 gets R1 in cycle 3 instead of waiting until cycle 5.

I3 gets R4 in cycle 6 instead of cycle 9.

No stalls are required.

Speedup = Better performance with forwarding.
