Problem 2: Structural Hazard Analysis

A four-stage pipeline has the following stages: Fetch (F), Decode (D), Execute (E), Write-back (W). The pipeline allows simultaneous execution except that only one instruction can access the memory (Fetch or Write-back) at a time.

How many stall cycles occur in the following instruction sequence?

I1: LOAD R1, 0(R2)  
I2: ADD R3, R1, R4  
I3: STORE R3, 0(R5)

Solution

I1 (LOAD) accesses memory in F (fetch) and W (write-back).

I3 (STORE) needs to access memory in E.


Since I1 and I3 both need memory access at different stages, we get a structural hazard.

Pipeline Diagram (without stalls)

One stall cycle occurs in cycle 5 when I3 is delayed because I1 is already using memory.

Total stalls = 1 cycle.
