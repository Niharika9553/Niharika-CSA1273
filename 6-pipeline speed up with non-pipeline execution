Problem 7: Pipeline Speedup with Non-Pipelined Execution

A non-pipelined processor takes 10 cycles per instruction. A pipelined version has 5 stages and an ideal CPI of 1.2 due to some stalls.

(a) Compute the speedup of the pipelined processor over the non-pipelined one.

Solution
{Speedup} = frac{Time per instruction (non-pipelined)}/{Time per instruction (pipelined)}

={10}{1.2} \approx 8.33

Thus, the pipelined processor is 8.33 times faster than the non-pipelined processor.
