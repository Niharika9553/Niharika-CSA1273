Problem 1: Impact of Cache Block Size on Performance

A processor has a 32 KB L1 cache with a block size of 32 bytes. The miss rate is 6%. When the block size is increased to 64 bytes, the miss rate drops to 4%, but the miss penalty increases by 10 cycles.

(a) Compute the AMAT (Average Memory Access Time) before and after the block size change.

(b) Is increasing the block size beneficial in this case? Why?

Solution

(a) AMAT Calculation

AMAT = \text{Hit Time} + (\text{Miss Rate} \times \text{Miss Penalty})

Let the hit time = 1 cycle and the original miss penalty = 50 cycles.

Before increasing block size:

AMAT = 1 + (0.06 \times 50) = 1 + 3 = 4 \text{ cycles}

After increasing block size:
New miss penalty = 60 cycles

AMAT = 1 + (0.04 \times 60) = 1 + 2.4 = 3.4 \text{ cycles}

(b) Is this beneficial?

Yes, because the AMAT is reduced from 4 cycles to 3.4 cycles, improving performance. However, increasing block size further could lead to increased conflict misses and wasted bandwidth.
