Problem 5: Pipeline Throughput Calculation

A pipelined processor has 6 stages, and each stage takes 1 ns. The pipeline operates at 2 GHz.

(a) What is the time taken to complete 1000 instructions in this pipeline?

(b) What is the throughput in instructions per second?

Solution

(a) Execution Time for 1000 Instructions

First instruction takes 6 ns (full pipeline fill).

After that, one instruction completes every 1 ns.

Total time for 1000 instructions:


6 + (1000 - 1) \times 1 = 1005 \text{ ns}

(b) Throughput Calculation

Throughput = Instructions per second


\text{Throughput} = \frac{\text{Total Instructions}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{1000}{1005 \times 10^{-9}}

\approx 9.95 \times 10^8 \text{ instructions per second}
